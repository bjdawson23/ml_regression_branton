## Clarity & Organization

1. The notebook structured and easy to follow.
2. Histograms were nice to look at and the color by region stood out nicely.

## Feature Selection

1. Feature Selection & Justification: bmi_smoker multiplying bmi and smoker to capture the combined effect of obesity and smoking.
   - Engineered interaction feature captures the compounded effect of high BMI and smoking on charges.

## Model Performance & Comparisons

1. Linear Regression with standard preprocessing performed best, achieving an R² of ~0.785 on the test set.

## Reflection Quality

1. Reflections were present for each section and are well thought out and easy to read.

## 4-point Repository Checklist

Verify the repository contains:

    1. Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
    2. Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
    3. Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
    4. Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)

**Key Takeaways for Author:**

Positive Feedback

- I chose Karto's project to review as it was the most recent and I found it interesting to see how we each looked at the data.

1. The systematic approach to algorithm comparison is exemplary
2. Feature engineering shows good domain knowledge
3. bmi_smoker was a great added feature

Constructive Feedback

1. There were some imports in sections 4 and 5. Those should be at the top.
