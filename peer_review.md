Notebook link: [Midterm Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/anjana-codes/ml_classification_anjana/blob/main/notebooks/classification_anjana.ipynb)

1. The notebook structured and easy to follow.
2. Feature Selection & Justification: All 13 inputs were chosen as they have a strong correlation with heart disease.
3. Reflections are well thought out and easy to read.

- I chose Anjana's project to review as it covered the same heart disease analysis that I did and found it very interesting.
- There is a second notebook completed covering HR Employee Attrition.  
**GREAT WORK ON BOTH!!**

## 4-point Repository Checklist

Verify the repository contains:

- [x] Jupyter Notebook has proper name, numbered sections and reflections.
- [x] README.md - the README file is very well organized and informative and has required information and project links
- [x] Dataset, stored in a data folder.  There is a data folder with the requied data file(s)
- [x] Peer Review (peer_review.md) - there is a required peer review file with a completed review.

## 📋 Review Summary

This peer review evaluates the heart disease classification project across multiple dimensions including methodology, code quality, analysis depth, and presentation. The project demonstrates solid machine learning fundamentals with room for enhancement in advanced techniques.

**Key Takeaways for Author:**

Positive Feedback

1. The systematic approach to algorithm comparison is exemplary
2. Feature engineering shows good domain knowledge

Constructive Feedback

1. I would only suggest trying another model for the analysis
